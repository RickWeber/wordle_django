Here's what I want:
* Today's correct answer (use the list of known answers and compare today to the
  first day).
* A chain of guesses class that will evaluate a set of guesses against a given
  word (today's answer by default). 
* A program to evaluate chains of guesses and return results aggregated by the
  first guess of those chains. (that will be a separate app)

I've already got Today's answer (fun fact, in two days the correct answer will
be "today"!) 

But I've got to sort my thinking on the guess chain class. 
It's really a game-progression class. It's how one game might play out for one
person. Down the line I could attach users to Guesses items so that users could
keep track of things.

What should be in this class?
* A correct word (by default, the actual correct word for the day the object is
created). 
* A method to accept a new guess (if we haven't run out of guesses).
* A method to figure out yellow and green squares
* A method to filter the list of possible words based on previous guesses
* A method to show some of those possible words.
